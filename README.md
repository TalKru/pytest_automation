Explanation of Key Components:

tests/: This directory houses all your test cases. Each file (e.g., test_login.py) contains one or more test functions.
conftest.py: This file is crucial for Pytest. It contains fixtures (setup and teardown methods) and hooks 
that are shared across multiple test files.
pages/: This directory implements the Page Object Model (POM). Each file represents a web page and contains methods for 
interacting with the elements on that page. This promotes code reusability and makes tests easier to maintain.
utils/: This directory contains utility functions and helper classes that are used throughout the project.
config.py: Stores configuration settings like URLs, browser types, and timeouts.
locators.py: (Optional) If you're not putting locators in your POM classes, you can store them here.
logger.py: Sets up logging for your tests.
webdriver_manager.py: Manages the WebDriver instances (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver).
data/: This directory stores test data, such as CSV or JSON files, that your tests might use.
reports/: This directory will contain the generated test reports after running your tests.
requirements.txt: This file lists all the project's dependencies (e.g., selenium, pytest). You can install them using 
pip install -r requirements.txt.
pytest.ini: This file contains Pytest configuration settings, such as markers, plugins, and report format.
README.md: This file provides a description of the project and instructions on how to run the tests.
